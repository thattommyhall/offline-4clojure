;; Split by Type - Medium
;; Write a function which takes a sequence consisting of items with different types and splits them up into a set of homogeneous sub-sequences. The internal order of each sub-sequence should be maintained, but the sub-sequences themselves can be returned in any order (this is why 'set' is used in the test cases).
