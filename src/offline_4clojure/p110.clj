;; Sequence of pronunciations - Medium
;; <p>Write a function that returns a lazy sequence of "pronunciations" of a sequence of numbers. A pronunciation of each element in the sequence consists of the number of repeating identical numbers and the number itself. For example, <code>[1 1]</code> is pronounced as <code>[2 1]</code> ("two ones"), which in turn is pronounced as <code>[1 2 1 1]</code> ("one two, one one").</p><p>Your function should accept an initial sequence of numbers, and return an infinite lazy sequence of pronunciations, each element being a pronunciation of the previous element.</p>
